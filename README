RDF::Trine - An RDF Framework for Perl.

   RDF::Trine provides an RDF framework with an emphasis on extensibility, API
   stability, and the presence of a test suite. The package consists of several
   components:

   * RDF::Trine::Model - RDF model providing access to a triple store.
   * RDF::Trine::Parser - Native RDF parsers (RDF/XML, RDFa, Turtle, and RDF/JSON).
   * RDF::Trine::Store::DBI - A triple store for MySQL and SQLite, based on the
     Redland schema.
   * RDF::Trine::Iterator - Iterator classes for variable bindings and RDF
     statements, used by RDF::Trine::Store, RDF::Trine::Model, and RDF::Query.
   * RDF::Trine::Namespace - A convenience class for easily constructing RDF
     node objects from URI namespaces.

     * Cleaned up ::Iterator::Bindings::as_string serialization code.
     * Replaced use of splice() with shift() in ::Iterator::SAXHandler::pull_result.

  Version 0.107 (2008-04-25)

     * Added Digest::SHA1 as a requirement for RDF::Trine.
     * Fixed base URI use in Turtle parser.
     * Fixed SQLite DSN in example scripts.
     * Fixed XML whitespace error in iterator-thaw.t

  Version 0.106 (2008-04-19)

     * Added a mysql-specific RDF::Trine::Store class (now uses INSERT IGNORE for efficiency).
     * SQL compiler now doesn't select statement contexts unless called via get_statements (not get_pattern).
     * RDF::Trine::Iterator::Graph::as_bindings now can be called with no arguments (uses default names).
     * Moved the nested hash join from ::Iterator to ::Iterator::Bindings.
     * Added new tests to improve coverage of node and iterator classes.
     * Added tests for binding iterator cartesian product join.
     * Pipelined the code for nested loop joins on binding iterators.
     * Added SPARQL XML Results test for identity hints in <link/> element.
     * Fixed bug in ::Model::StatementFilter to call join_steams in ::Iterator::Bindings.
     * Fixed bug in ::Iterator::Graph::as_bindings where not all arguments are ::Node::Variable objects.
     * Updated SPARQL XML Results namespace for boolean iterators.
     * Replaced XML::Twig code with new XML::SAX parser (allowing streaming parsing).
     * Moved as_sparql methods from RDF::Trine:: to RDF::Query:: classes.
     * RDF::Trine::Iterator::smap now allows overriding default construct_args (e.g. binding names).
     * Fixed RDF::Trine::Model::StatementFilter::get_pattern to project away unused variables (fixing a bug that caused joining to always fail).
     * Updated example turtle parser to accept URLs as command line arguments.
     * Turtle parser now removes dashes from the UUIDs used for blank node IDs.
     * Added support to incrementally thaw an Iterator from an IO::Socket.
     * Added RDF::Trine::Iterator::SAXHandler::rate method.
     * Added Time::HiRes as prerequisite to META.yml and Makefile.PL.
     * Updated all RDF::Trine modules to use consistent VERSION number for 0.106 release.
     * Added examples directory (and an example script) to the RDF-Trine package.
     * Removed Bloom::Filtere from the list of prerequisites (functionality has moved to RDF::Query).

  Version 0.105 (2008-03-19)

     * Removed use of File::Slurp in parser tests.

  Version 0.104 (2008-03-14)

     * Updated SPARQL XML Results namespace declaration in RDF::Trine::Iterator serialization methods.
     * Added extra_result_data methods to add data to the XML Results <link/> header tag.
     * RDF::Trine::Node::Resource now serializes to QName when passed valid namespace data.
     * Fixed xml results serialization for style.

  Version 0.103 (2008-03-10)

     * Updated to recognize (renamed) RDF::Query::Expression class.

  Version 0.102 (2008-03-07)

     * Added length() method to Materialized bindings iterator class.
     * Removed bloom filter construction from bindings iterator (RDF::Query code now does this itself).
     * Fixed escaping of backslashes in Literal node serialization.

  Version 0.101 (2008-03-04)

     * Added an RDF/XML parser based on RDF::Core::Parser.
     * Added Bloom filter support for Materialized bindings iterators.
     * Fixed IRI workaround using the URI module.
     * Turtle parser now uses Data::UUID for unique names.
     * Fixed turtle parser bug for Verb testing.
     * Added RDF::Trine::Statement::Quad::from_redland method.
     * DBI store now constrains variable node types based on position in a statement.
     * Added support for BOUND(), ISLITERAL(), ISURI() and ISIRI() functions in DBI store.

  Version 0.100 (2008-02-18)

     * Initial public release.
